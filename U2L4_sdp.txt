1. They need to be able to line up correct in the size of the matix. otherwise there is no solution

2. basically the same thing as the first but you just need to be careful with negatives. 

3.multiply the first by the height which is len and then for the second matix you use len inside one of the nested lists to get the length

4. the outer loop is the height(just len of the list) and the length(len inside one of the lists in the nested list)

5.
